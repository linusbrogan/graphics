Homogeneous coordinates
	x, y, z, and dummy 1
	Makes translation a matrix multiplication problem

In CS-367, we assumed the viewer was at the origin, looking at the +z-axis, with the +y-axis up.
Now we want an arbitrary perspective.
If the camera was moved to (2, 5, 1), for example, then we could equivalently move the world -(2, 5, 1) to get the same view.

Objects are built in "object space."
Each object gets some transformation to end up in the right place in the "world space."
We can also put a light and camera somewhere in world space.
To orient the camera, it also gets a "Center of Interest" and an "Up Point."

To bring the camera back to its default location:
- Translate the camera by the negative of its location.
- Rotate about the y-axis to bring the CoI onto the y-z plane.
- Rotate about the x-axis to bring the CoI onto the z-axis.
- Rotate about the z-axis to bring the Up Point onto the y-z plane.
The transformation matrix for this sequence is the "View Matrix".
Apply the view matrix to all objects to get the right picture from the default camera.
