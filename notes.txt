->RAY TRACING
Z_BUFFER handles hiding objects well, overlaps
but not good when we zoom in
zoom in, what do you think?
bad at reflection/refracction
shadows???
trransparency?

Now project ray from eye through pixel into world/objects
Find closest intersection, do light moedl, tadah
no zbuf
follow reflected rays from mirrors, maybe blend colors
best looking
can find shadows, reflect to light, and see blocked path
how to find intersection?
easy for simple, hard for complx objects
